# Kiks Travel API Security Implementation

## Overview
This directory contains the API endpoints for the Kiks Travel website. Security improvements have been implemented to protect sensitive information and prevent common web vulnerabilities.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```
   cd /path/to/kikssitevf2-main/public/api
   composer install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - The `.env` file contains sensitive configuration information
   - Make sure this file is never committed to version control
   - Use the `.env.example` file as a template if you need to recreate the `.env` file

## Security Features Implemented

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Sensitive credentials are now stored in environment variables
   - Credentials are no longer hardcoded in the source code

2. **Secure Email Handling**
   - Using PHPMailer for secure, authenticated SMTP email sending
   - Proper error handling and logging

3. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
   - All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
   - Required fields are checked before processing

4. **CORS Protection**
   - Restricted Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to specific domains
   - Proper handling of preflight requests

5. **Error Handling**
   - Improved error messages without exposing sensitive information
   - Proper HTTP status codes for different error scenarios

## Important Notes

- The `.env` file contains real credentials and should be protected
- The `.gitignore` file has been updated to exclude sensitive files from version control
- All functionality remains the same while improving security
